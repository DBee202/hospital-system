Hospital System 
 a backend system for a hospital that handles user signups, patient–doctor assignments, doctor note submissions, and dynamic scheduling of actionable steps based on live LLM processing. The system must secure sensitive data and use a live LLM to extract actionable steps—divided into a checklist (immediate tasks) and a plan (scheduled actions). New note submissions should cancel any existing actionable steps and create new ones.
